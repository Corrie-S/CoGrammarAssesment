Hi Student,

While you are almost there in completing the task, it is important to remember that anything that is typed in a comment line (starting with '//') is ignored when the code is executed, even code statements. That means that if you have a statement on a comment line it will not be executed when you run the code. 

Furthermore, it is good practice and improves readability of your code (especially when trying to find bugs) when you put each statement on a new line instead of typing multiple statements on a single line. A simple rule of thumb would be to start on a new line after every semi-colon (;) and opening and closing braces ({}).

One more thing to keep in mind when importing library functions/objects is that when you use only one or two functions/objects from a library, it is more efficient to import the specific function/object that you are using instead of the unused ones as well with wildcard(*) imports. Your code will use less memory and time when executing.

Looking forward to seeing your improved code soon.
